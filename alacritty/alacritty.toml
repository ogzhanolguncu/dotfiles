# TERM variable
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
# You can check the TERM variable with echo $TERM outside of tmux

# When using "alacritty" in alacritty and "tmux-256color" in tmux, I was having paste 
# issues when I pasted over text highlighted in visual mode, spaces were removed 
# at the end of the text. This happened in NEOVIM specifically
